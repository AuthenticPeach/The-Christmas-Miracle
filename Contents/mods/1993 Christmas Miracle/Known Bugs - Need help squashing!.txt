To whom it may be concerned, I will list the known current bugs here so that players would know the boundaries of the mod and 
the code. It would be so great if anyone can help suggest and fix these bugs (I'll give you credit for it).

----Known Bugs----
-Christmas Miracle - 
/// Starting a new save and not moving the inital truck, then quiting and loading back into the save will produce a second truck
on top of the first one. Good luck moving that. 

/// When Crafting the superweapons - the Bell Ringer and The Sleigher, there is a chance of it flagging an error. Disregard it, 
its an intermittent thing, the recipe and function all work as intended. 

/// When unwrapping the presents or opening the map capsule, there is - by my estimates - a 6.5% chance of it not producing 
anything. This is why I provide a 2nd map capsule in the glovebox in the event of this. 

This is also to say that this mod may conflict with other mods - if you want me to ATTEMPT to make things compatible. Send me
